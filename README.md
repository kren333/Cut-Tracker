# Cut-Tracker

As someone looking to improve my physical health, I recently began tracking my weight each morning after waking up and at night before going to bed, in combination with a regular workout routine and an improved diet. In order to track my progress and evaluate trends in weight over time, I created this primarily time-series-based analysis of the data that I collect, to be updated monthly with each new set of data.
